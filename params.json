To scale this out, you would have to just create heroku account as much as possible but to handle that much of accounts would be very tedious. Hence the reason why I wrote this rake tasks. It would help you be more organized and easily scale to number of heroku accounts without worrying about of which account need to be deployed for specific services.\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites.\r\n- rake\r\n- heroku accounts\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n```\r\nrake -T\r\nrake deploy:<service name>[s]\r\nrake deploy:<service name>[staging]\r\nrake config:<service name>[production]\r\nrake config:set:<service name>[p]\r\nrake start:<service name>[p]\r\nrake restart:<service name>[p]\r\nrake .....\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nIf you think this is awesome, and want to make it even more awesome, then feel free to contribute to this project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
